    In a garden full of light,
Flowers bloom both day and night.
Birds sing songs so very bright,
Everything just feels so right.

A little stream flows with ease,
Whispering to the trees and bees.
Sunshine dances through the leaves,
A gentle, calming, warm breeze.

In this place, I love to roam,
It feels just like a dreamy home.
Where happiness freely roams,
In this garden, I am never alone.
